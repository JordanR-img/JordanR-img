### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Junior DevOps Engineer at ACC, I have big dreams and hopeful to see them come to fruition. I studied full stack development also, so I have dabbled in quite a few areas.

If i'm not at my computer i'm with my wife going for a walk (or sitting on the couch) ðŸ˜… or with friends enjoying company. I could be with my church family, playing drums or playing video games.

You can reach out to me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-robinson-009109263/ 

Send me a message if you want a chat! Always happy to try and make new friends ðŸ˜€

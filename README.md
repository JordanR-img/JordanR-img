### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack developer who is based in Wellington NZ. Looking to grow, to learn, to see ideas become reality. I have just completed an internship at Dacreed! Now I am excited to learn new tech and expand my own horizon. 

Me and my friend have some app ideas in mind we are wanting to create! Stay tuned here for more details and updates to these projects.

If i'm not at my computer i'm with my wife going for a walk (or sitting on the couch) ðŸ˜… or with friends enjoying company. I could be with my church family, playing drums or playing video games.

You can reach out to me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-robinson-009109263/ 

Send me a message if you want a chat! Always happy to try and make new friends ðŸ˜€
